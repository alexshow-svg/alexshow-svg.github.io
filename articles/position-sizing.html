      <h2>What position sizing really means</h2>
      <p>
        Position sizing is the decision of <strong>how big</strong> a trade is relative to your account.
        Not which asset to trade. Not where to enter.
        Just one question:
      </p>
      <p><strong>“If this trade fails, how much do I lose?”</strong></p>

      <p>
        Good traders think in terms of <em>loss first</em>, not profit first.
      </p>

      <h2>Why position sizing matters more than entries</h2>
      <p>
        Two traders can take the same trade and have completely different outcomes.
        The difference is rarely the entry — it’s the size.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A bad entry with small size is survivable.</li>
        <li>A great entry with oversized risk can destroy weeks or months of progress.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is why position sizing is not a detail.
        It’s the foundation.
      </p>

      <h2>The hidden psychological effect of size</h2>
      <p>
        Oversized positions don’t just increase losses — they change behavior.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Stops get moved because the loss “feels too big”.</li>
        <li>Trades are closed early because profits feel fragile.</li>
        <li>Revenge trading becomes more likely after losses.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Proper sizing keeps emotions within a controllable range.
        It allows you to execute a plan instead of reacting to fear.
      </p>

      <h2>Common position sizing mistakes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Thinking in position value instead of risk</strong><br />
          “I bought €500 worth” means nothing without knowing the stop distance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Using the same size for every trade</strong><br />
          Volatility changes. Stops change. Size must adapt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increasing size after losses</strong><br />
          This feels logical emotionally, but it accelerates drawdowns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The simple principle</h2>
      <p>
        Decide <strong>how much of your account you are willing to lose</strong> on a trade,
        then size the position so that the stop-loss defines that loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is usually expressed as a percentage of the account
        (for example: 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1% per trade).
      </p>

      <p>
        Smaller risk does not mean smaller profits.
        It means smoother equity curves and longer survival.
      </p>

      <h2>From concept to numbers</h2>
      <p>
        Knowing the idea is not enough.
        Position sizing must be calculated, not guessed.

        It tells you how to survive when you’re wrong.
